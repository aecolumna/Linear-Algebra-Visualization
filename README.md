# Linear-Algebra-Visualizations

## Interactive applets that shows how vectors transform

Linear Algebra can be dry. Especially if you find it hard to imagine linear transformations. Many concepts, like Eigenvectors, and solutions to systems of equations, are easy to understand visually. This helped me in my linear algebra course. Hope it helps you too.
